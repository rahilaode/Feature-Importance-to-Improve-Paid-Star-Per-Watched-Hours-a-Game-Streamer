# Problem Statement
A leading agency representing content creators on Gaming committed to help streamers increase their revenues by leveraging the rich source of streaming data to provide actionable insights. In this problem, we want to learn whether certain features of streamers will make them more or less likely to receive stars from their audience, in this case PaidStarPerWatchedHour is the dependent variable. 

# Dataset Description
This dataset consists of more than 600 streamers (Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines). Each row represents data of one unique streamer. There are different sets of facial features extracted using an AI tool (e.g., Self_Esteem_, Character_Facet_, Personal_Values_Facet_, Temperament_), in addition to Gender, Game, Country, Total Follower, and the role they play in the game (e.g., Role_Director).
